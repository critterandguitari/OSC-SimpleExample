# OSC-SimpleExample

The OSC library (in /OSC) is from the CNMAT Arduino OSC implementation, with slight modifications to make it platform independent.  The OSC messages may then be sent and received using any kind of transport.  The main.cpp demonstrates sending and receiving over SLIP serial and UDP.
